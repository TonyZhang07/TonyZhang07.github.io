                    <p style='margin-top: 1%;' class='textStyle'>Where do we go when we die? Is it our soul that goes? What defines as a soul? There are
                        many more questions about what happens after death, but specifically, what happens to the soul
                        when we do die? Since ancient times, these questions about soul and life after death have been
                        explored countless times by many known Greek philosophers such as Aristotle, Plato, and
                        Epicurus. These questions were also answered and explored by the sacred texts of religions we
                        know of today, specifically Christianity and Judaism. But how does the human soul behave after
                        the “body” dies in Ancient Greece compared to those in Christianity and Judaism, and how did
                        the beliefs differ in the creation of one’s soul?
                    </p>
                    <p class='textStyle'>The thought of death is something that everyone thinks about. In this page, I will go into details about our soul, because in in Christanity, Ancient Greece,
                    and Judaism, they all believed in the thought that the humans has a soul. Everyone human has a soul. And I will go into how each one of them thinks.

                <p class='textStyle'> “And the Lord God formed man of the
slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul”
(Book of Genesis/Bible, Chapter 2 - 7). This suggests that we humans at first did not possess a
soul at first, but it was because of God that we have received the soul. Thus, giving us the idea
that a soul was given to the people by God.</p>
            <p class='textStyle'>Christianity and Judaism share similar thoughts of the soul, one example is how God has
<img src="images/sixty_seconds_for_a_soul-1379621766m.jpg" style='float: left; height: 300px; width: 100px; margin: 5px'>created men, in the Book of Genesis, it is stated that, “And the Lord God formed man of the
slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul”
(Book of Genesis/Bible, Chapter 2 - 7). This suggests that humans did not possess a
soul at first, but it was because of God that we have received the soul. Thus, gives the idea
that a soul was given to the people by God</p>
            <p class='textStyle'>Matthew 10:28
“And do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” This suggests that even after death, those who are "dead" will presumebly live on.
            </p>
            <p class='textStyle'>In death, Christianity’s belief that the soul will return to God when one dies. In the Book
of Ecclesiastes of the Bible, it is said, “And the dust return into its earth, from whence it was, and
the spirit return to God, who gave it” (Book of Ecclesiastes – Bible, Chapter 12 – 7). This
suggests that the soul does not keep on living on as different people have different souls.</p>

            <h2 style='text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1%'><u>Ancient Greece</u></h2>
                <p class='textStyle' style="margin-top: 1%">
                      In the
fifth century, having a soul simply means that you are alive (Lorenz Hendrik, Ancient Theories
of Soul). While the two’s thoughts of how the soul came to be is different, the part where life
requires the soul stays the same within the three different thoughts and ideas.
                </p>
                    <p class='textStyle'>In the <i>Odyssey</i>, when Odysseus goes down into the underworld, he is encountered by one
                    of his shipmates, Elpenor and asked why he is down here. Elpenor describes what happened to <img src="images/Land-of-the-dead.jpg.crdownload" style="float: right; margin: 5px" alt='Land of the Dead'><figcaption>Land of the Dead - Styx</figcaption>
                    him and how he died while also saying, “my soul flew down to Death” (Homer, Book 11 of the
                    Odyssey, 176). This tells us that even though he has been declared “dead” in the regular world,
                    he still retains his ego and is able to think. This shows that the soul doesn’t go anywhere but
                    stays and wanders in the Underworld.</p>
                <p class='textStyle'>In <i>Phaedo</i>, when asked the question, “Is the soul immortal?” Cebes has replied with, “It
is” and the person asking the question, replied “Good” as if the group as agreed upon the answer
(Pluto, Phaedo, 60). Because they are considered the “best” philosophers during that time, it can
be implied that their thoughts may have a massive impact onto the publics view of thinking and
as a result – we can think that most of the public’s view of the soul could be similar. Many Gree
philosophers have thought the same thing about the soul, and it is the fact that the soul is
indestructible and immortal (Pluto, Phaedo, 62-63).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="column" style="background-color:#ccc;">
            <h2 style='text-align: center'><u>Judaism</u></h2>
            <p class='textStyle'>The people of Judaism also believes something similar to what Christanity believes in.</p>    
            <p class='textStyle'> In the Hebrew, where
“Then the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the
breath of life; and man became a living soul” (Hebrew – Genesis, Chapter 2 – 7).</p>
            <p class='textStyle'>“A Jewish soul has an intrinsic “spirit of holiness and purity” to
it, a spirit that can purge itself of any “impure spirits and powers” that wish to attach themselves
to the body” (Saul Epstein and Sara Libby Robinson, The Soul, Evil Spirits, and the Undead:
<img src="images/soulleaving.jpg" style='float: left; height: 300px; width: 100px; margin: 5px'>Vampires, Death, and Burial in Jewish Folklore and Law, 240). This statement reasons that the
soul is the meaning or is the spirit of something pure and has a holiness that one must protect
from the evils of the words, such as sins. According to the <i>Body and Soul</i>, the soul exists in two
places, one is separated from the body and that they exist in a fully conscious state in the ethereal
realm (My Jewish Learning Body and soul). In the Hebrew, it is stated that, “For the living know
that they shall die; but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the
memory of them is forgotten.” (Ecclesiates – Hebrew, 9 – 5) This statement is similar to that of
what happens in Christianity where the souls of the “current” people are lost, and their memories
are gone.</p>

                    <p style='margin-top: 1%;' class='textStyle'>
                        This matters because lets say you were to die, what do you think would happen? Would you think it is over? Or would you think you would keep living on? Because people like Aristole have thought
                        about what happens after death, it also gives people the imagination, or the hope that there's potentially life after death, or in some cases reincarination.
                    </p>
                    <p class='textStyle'> 
                        If people who think that the soul is the God's Gift, it is important to also know where the soul is going, whether it's being punished, or staying at one place, or being reincarinated.
