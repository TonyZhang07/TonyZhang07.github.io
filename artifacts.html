          <div class='left_artifact_subBox'> <u>Project 1:</u><br>Proposal</div>
          <p class='textStyle'>My topic is going to be about the different experiences of human interactions with different emotions. I am qualified to do this topic because I work in a restaurant as a server and as you may guessed, yes. I do deal with people. With that I want to expand my knowledge of understanding the emotions I have now to help better understand how and what I can do to help those with a shitty day a little bit better. I have been working as a server for a while now and before that I was a host. Someone who seats people down at tables. I do have a few couple years of experience of human interaction and of many are shitty ones. As for resources, there are many. One of them is me and others can include the police, people that are in the student union and basically everyone who is working with people. Students and teachers also work as well. So basically, I want to do this project on human interactions and how different emotes effect different interactions.</p>
          <br class='indent'>My research ideas are:
          <li class='textStyle'>What are some signs you should look for in order to tell how they’re truly feeling?</li>
          <li class='textStyle'>How do you deal with people that are clearly having a bad day?</li>
          <li class='textStyle'>What can you do to get one to talk to you?</li>
          <li class='textStyle'>What is the best way to piss off someone you’ve just met? </li>
          <li class='textStyle'>What is the best way to calm down someone who’s stressed and/or mad/clearly not in a good state?</li>
          <p class='textStyle'>Things like playing with the human emotions is what I’m trying to change my project into. </p>

            <div class='rightsubBox'><u>Project 1:</u><br>Research Report</div>
            <p class='textStyle'>The research idea I am doing is How do Humans Deal with Each Others' Emotions.</p>
            <p class='textStyle'>From the research that I observed myself and the people I observed, I got one main thing. Those who have to deal with other people in jobs will just suck it up. But depending on how differently people start off the conversation such as their tone will decide what kind of conversation will happen. Someone walked into the library and yes I am doing it on the staff of the library as they do interact with people and they have a break as well, which gives them a chance to reset their emotions unlike the workers in the student union where it's super busy all the time and basically no breaks to reset their emotions and thoughts. So, someone walked into the library asking if they had a mask, and obviously he wasn't trying to make it a big deal out of it, but the tone he used is sort of aggressive but not really. It's a little bit aggressive and the staff replied with just about as much or a little bit less of aggression. Because it's their job. After their little conversation, he said thank you and went on his way, and the staff treated him kindly as well. What I got was that people will treat you based off of what you treat them. It's obvious but we, as human beings tend to forget the most obvious things that are in front of our face. Another example is when I get mad, I tend to make other people mad as well. Sure, it's different for other people but "emotions are highly contagious" (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/high-octane-women/201210/emotions-are-contagious-choose-your-company-wisely). Going back to the staff at the library, they are nice and will be nice because they are supposed to hold it in. They will not burst in front of you which is why I chose this place. The sudden helpfulness that they give to people from time to time gives them a chance to reset their thoughts and have a calm piece of mindset. People can catch other people's emotions. Those who are angry will make the people around them angry, because it has happened this weekend. Those who are enjoying themselves will make others enjoy themselves as well. The sudden no peopleness of the staff in the library helps them to talk to teach other and communicate as a team so they can sort out the problems by themselves. They have a different response to each person depending on their tone. People who say "hi" or "hello" generally have a response of "Hi, how can I help you?" or something similar to that. Of course, those who are focused on the thing they're doing will do great because human emotions will play a role in that factor as well. These are the things I got from the hour long observation in the library and my own experiences as well. </p>

            <div class='rightsubbox'><u>Project 2</u><br>Rough Draft</div>
            <p class='textStyle'>Programming is everywhere today. Almost everything that’s automated is done through programming. Websites, Robots, and all the stuff we couldn’t have before were all done through programming. In my opinion, Programming is one of the necessary pillars to society as the world is getting more advanced with the continuation of technological advancement. </p>
            <p class='textStyle'>Programming in the real world is hard. The term “programming” nowadays is being coined towards the Computer Science industry because of all the programs the programmers or coders have to code in order for the program to start working. Programming isn’t easy. You need to use a lot of logic inside of your program to get it working. Most jobs in that industry are quite similar. They’re all sit at desk and code type of jobs.</p>
            <p class='textStyle'>  A lot of jobs you can find in this industry is within companies with either desks with computers or work from home. Most of the common jobs you’ll find are, software development, software engineer, computer programmer, and all those jobs that require coding, they’re more or less referencing the same thing, which is to be able to code and apply your knowledge on a professional manner.</p>
            <p class='textStyle'>   Introduction of jobs like developers and testers.</p>
            <p class='textStyle'>  Developer and testers are an important part when it comes into this industry. A developer is someone who works and develops the program where as the testers tests to see if the program works efficiently or not while also providing feedback on what areas that’s needed to improve on. One example could be a developer for a game and a tester would be a player who would give their thoughts on the game process, character design, mechanics and much more.</p>
            <p class='textStyle'> Relationships between developers and testers. Developers tend to maximize efficiency in coding, which basically means that they build defined functionality with the fewest lines of code in the most efficient way possible. Whereas in testers, they seek to maximize effectiveness which is basically to deliver the software of the best quality to the audience. One of the most obvious things about the relationships between developers and testers is the experiences. For all we know, the test could have 0 knowledge of how to implement the changes they’ve recommended and obviously the developers tend to have more experience.</p>
            <p class='textStyle'>The actual workload inside of the Computer Science Industry have a lot of deadlines. Most of the times they are working in groups on a single part of a larger project. This means that people who are in the industry need to have great communication skills in order to express their thought process not only in a simple way but to also be able to explain it technical way so that people with different technical and programming experiences can understand what someone is saying. It also forces the people who work in that industry to work with others. Because they are all working on different parts of a single project, you need each others code in order to sync up the process so it makes a harmony that work together that make up a song as a result. Deadlines are really important in that industry because people are on their computers all day long, there will be distractions and I think that the deadline is there not only is to create pressure so that they can work more while working efficiently but it also boosts up the process of helping each other reach their own deadlines so that you can benefit off of their code to finish up your deadline as well.</p>
            <p class='textStyle'>Getting a job is easy and hard at the same time in the Computer Science Industry. Because there’s so many job opportunities in the industry, there’s also a lot of people in the industry as well. That’s the easy part. You can do well enough to start a business if you have enough background knowledge but the hard part is when your applying the stuff that you know towards a real life experience, and also finding the opportunity for that too. Companies look for those who stand out in order for the company to make money. Those who stand out could look better and more appealing to the companies, while also knowing a large variety of coding languages will also help tremendously.</p>
            <p class='textStyle'>  Personal Experiences with Programming I have are my classes. The only programming knowledge I have right now is through the classes I took. I took a computer science course in high school and decided to take it as a major in college. One of the most important things I got out of it was to take your time into doing projects or big assignments because programming is very tedious and annoying.  </p>

            <div class='left_artifact_subbox'><u>Project 2:</u><br>Interview</div>
            <ol type='1'>
                <li>Many early software developers and programmers have mainly taught themselves how to do many things with code. Did you manage to self-teach yourself to code in the beginning and then move onto coding classes or did you take coding classes as an entrance in the world of code? </li> 
                <p style='textStyle'>“My experience in computer science. I did not have any programming experience prior to taking any classes. That essentially enabled me to started the program from the ground up.”</p>
                <li>What made you decide to take part in the Computer Science Industry?</li> 
                <p style='textStyle'>“Originally I was part of the engineering college and my major was aerospace engineering. In my experience I expected Aerospace engineering to be a bit similar to computer science. I thought I was going to be doing more programming and things like that and I found that there was a lot more physics and math courses that I need to take as prerequisites until I was politely asked to leave the college of engineering and I spent one semester on academic probation within the college of letters arts and sciences. And that semester I met with an advisor and stumbled upon computer science and I’ve never really looked back. I guess my interest has always come from I guess from the fact that I’m interested in computers and technology.</p>
                <li>What were your dreams in the Computer Science industry? And have you achieved it? If so, could you tell me your story of how you achieved it.</li> 
                <p style='textStyle'>"So one dream I did accomplish while I was a student in this industry was I always wanted to work for NASA. I’ve always wanted to be an astronaut. But more specifically I found out was I wanted to take my computational, my computer science skills and apply that to some type of NASA project. And I was able to in my final semester, in my senior year in computer science I was a software engineering intern at the NASA Osiris-rex mission and there I was able to create a thing what is called a downlink report page. That is still being used as a tool today in that industry. Space has always been my particular interest and so it was so it was wholemark and culminating moment to be able to take my experiences and work on the NASA project."</p>
                
                <li>What was one of the most important skills you learned while working with NASA?</li> 
                <p style='textStyle'>“"I think that outside of the technical skills that I learned in terms of I guess apply computer science principles to real work applications. The biggest thing was the idea behind working on a team and collaboration. Because in that role I was not only working with not only software engineers I was also working with system engineers I was working with data visualizers I was working with data scientists. Industrial engineers and so for me. It was really the idea behind being able to work on a team thats very interdisciplinary and being able not only to just work on a team but to work effectively on a team so all the ideas of conflict resolution I was able to in that semester make a lot of connections and outreach such that when I am fortunate enough to go back and visit the office there are a lot of people that still remember my name and face. Which is very great and that has really formed and developed my relationship there to the point now where there are, if there are opportunities of Osiris-rex, they reach primarily out to me to find CS students to participate so it was really the being able to work in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary team and being able to walk away with more connections then walking in."</p>
                
                <li>One thing that I got out from that is the idea that working collaboratively and communicating efficiently is an extremely important skill in that project you’ve worked on with NASA.</li> 
                <p style='textStyle'>"Not only in project. But one thing you will find in the computer science industry the computer science profession, it is becoming more and more collaborative, so now you are going to be expected in industry to work on teams of 4-5+ individuals that aren’t going to always share your educational background not always going to share your technical background and how you work on a team to get the same problem solved so it was communication, collaboration were definitely really important to be successful in that project but they are also becoming more and more important across the entire computer science industry. It is not always about how much you know. How technical you are, but being able to communicate all of those technical concepts in those terms in a way that non technical people can understand is a very valuable skill."</p>
                
                <li>What was another skill that you had gained because of the deadlines that you had to meet while working with NASA?</li> 
                <p style='textStyle'>"That's a really good question. I think the biggest one was learning how to ask better questions. Rather than going to you know my manager, my supervisor, and sitting down and saying “Hey, I don’t understand this can you help me” I started to um, ask more direct and educated questions that helped me to have a better fundamental understanding of the entire system that we were utilizing but also it provided more mentorship opportunities. For one example, when I first started, it was about 2-3 weeks before the spacecraft was going to launch, and so as you can imagine  2-3 weeks out of that final launch window, there was a huge deadline to submit code as it applied to downlink report, as it applied to a lot of other things and one of the instances was I was able to work with that software engineering team and to get a piece of code that was going to be vital for some of the instruments that were on that spacecraft and get that uploaded to the central repository before launch. So there was this video of your in a high time crunch and when your trying to meet multiple deadlines. The idea was that I was utilizing my resources as much as possible so that I can ask better questions and so we can actually get that piece of code uploaded to that piece of repository before the launch actually happened."</p>
                
                <li>Have you worked with different companies and businesses that has had similar workloads?</li> 
                <p style='textStyle'>"Unfortunately not, that was my only experience within the industry. Applying things outside of classroom, of course I did apply to internships and positions elsewhere but the Osiris-rex software experience was really the only professional experience that I had implementing the um, implementing computer science knowledge on a real world application. However, I did in my undergraduate TA for a computer science class. And as you can understand, being a TA requires a different skill set. You have to be able to 1. Be able to know the content well enough, but 2. You have to have very good communication skills to be able to convey that content to students that have different technical background, that also have different levels of um, English in terms of their interpretation and so that was another experience where I was able to take my computer science concepts and particularly I was leading a section where my role was to help students understand the fundamentals of programming, python, loops, if statements, and things like that."</p>
                
                <li>Do you have any favorite personal projects that you’ve done with coding?</li> 
                <p style='textStyle'>"I think thats a tough one because I haven’t done any personal projects. All of my projects are either for that internship or for class. Although I would say that in terms of a less academic project. One of the projects that I’ve done as a result of some of the information I’ve learned in classes was is I was able to scrape Twitter data using Twitter api into visualize a social network graph for one of my favorite rappers. So that would be one where we learned how to do all the visualization and to scrape data for topics in public policy but I went ahead and extended that and started to visualize the social network surrounding my favorite artist my those musicians."</p>
                
                <li>Are there any differences between job titles like Software Developer, Engineer, and Programmer?</li> 
                <p style='textStyle'>"So it really does depend. This is a really good question cause often times its hard to determine with how many job titles are out there. But more traditionally any time your seeing software development, software engineering, computer programmer, full stack developer, they are all referencing more or less the same thing. An individual that has expertise and skills in lets say, programming in general. The only difference between lets say a full stack developer is the full stack includes the front end, the web development and also your back end development as it applies to databases whereas you may see a role at a company that has labeled a software engineer but a lot of roles and responsibilities that your performing as part of that title are equivalent to lets say a programmer. So it’s one of those things where you look at job descriptions, the job title can often times give you a little bit more insight into the kind of roles and responsibilities and qualifications but it is not universal across the field. So you may see software developer, software engineer, full stack engineer, full stack developer, computer programmer, associate engineer, software engineering associate and so really the important thing is within those specific companies within those employers, you’ll want to start to learn the difference between a software developer here at lets say google versus a software developer maybe at wraithion."</p>
                
                <li>Have you ever dealt with hackers before?</li> 
                <p style='textStyle'>"In what capacity? Personal or Professional?"</p>
                
                <li> The professional experience</li>
                <p style='textStyle'>"I have not run into any hackers. Although the computer security course we have here did provide a lot of information on how hackers actually get access into your information and how they make those exploits. But I’ve never personally come across any hacking in my internship or any professional experience."</p>
                
                <li>What’s your opinions who do hack illegally?</li>
                <p style='textStyle'>"My opinion on those who hack illegally. That is a very interest question. I think that if the intent is afferious (don't know how to spell it I'm sorry) - meaning that they are wanting to take advantage of you personally in some type of way, that is not something I agree with. But often times hackers are enabling us to discover where certain holes and vulnerabilities are in our code so there are what are termed you know your white hat hacker, the black hat so people hacking for good and people hacking for not so good, so I would say those people that are looking to hack to gain information to exploit some type of system, society or individuals, that is not something I necessarily agree with but if you have a hacker whose trying to figure out how to get into a system to identify vulnerabilities and exploitations, that type of hacking is only going to help the software itself to become more robust and adaptable to different scenarios."</p>
                
                <li>What is the most complicated technical problem that you’ve encountered while working on the Osirs-rex project?</li>
                <p style='textStyle'>"I guess, I guess there's two-ish. The first one being going into a project and having to learn a new programming language or a new set of tools and technologies that you’ve never been expected or you never learned before and actually having to produce like a visual project on that. So that was probably the biggest thing, the first couple weeks that I was describing, My role, my responsibilities was, to learn angular, to learn javascript, to learn html, to learn css which I’ve been introduced to to some of my other courses but I’ve never really had to produce an actual page and so for me the biggest problem there was taking all of my expertise in python, java, c and then being able to use that intuitive nature in order to learn some of the other tools and technologies. One of my headaches that I used to get while I was at OSirs-rex is when you start learning about version control, when you start learning git, is a way for us to edit and modify the same code without there being you having a version and I having a version and then being different. It allows us to be on the same page. One thing that will happen though, if your not careful you will get what they call merge conflict, and merge conflicts happen when your working on a piece of code, someone else is working on a piece of code and they don’t necessarily line up and in terms of when their versions are submitted and updated. This typically happens when your again two different people working on the same code. For whatever reason and still I will never understand I somehow was able to get merge conflicts with my own code. So no one else was touching my code but I was getting merge conflicts with my own code. So it came down to a lack of understanding of how to properly navigate git and those command lines or those git commands you could say."</p>
                
                <li>Which language in programming would you say is the most efficient?</li>
                <p style='textStyle'>"Um, the most efficient in what aspect? The most efficient in terms of how fast it runs? Or the most efficient in terms of its capabilities of what it can do."</p>
                
                <li>In terms of its capabilities.</li>
                <p style='textStyle'>"So it really depends because there are some pros and cons with every programming language. Java happens to be very very popular, a lot of systems run on java software, but Java in terms of its robustly it tends to be more blackboxy if you will as compared to python right. And if you look at python, it’s very syntality from things like your c or your c++ so I dont think one is at the end of the day the most efficient, I think that depending on your application, it may be more beneficial for you to implement a solution in c vs implementing it in python because of how the information or the underlying structure is. So I would say it really depends on your end use case."</p>
                
                <li>What's your favorite programming language?</li>
                <p style='textStyle'>"My favorite programming language is probably going to be C. I hate Java and I know thats something a computer scientists shouldnt be saying right, because Java is one of the most popular ones out there but again, theres something about the idea that when your first learning java and all of these things theres a lot thats going on behind the scenes in terms of its garbage collector the compiler that I never really understood and it was one of those things when you call a function where oh java handles it, it will take care of it right? And when your working with C, you don’t really get a lot of that benefit right? Because you actually have to manually garbage collect and to free up your resources. I liked it because I get to finally understand and visualize linklist through the usage of pointers. So C was my favorite primary because it was one of the hardest ones that you can learn, but I think that because I think that it was one of the hardest ones syntactically, one of the most forbost and one that you have pay the most attention to, I feel like I had a better and solid understanding of programming in general. I hate java which I love C which I know it might be different from your personal preferences or for the majority of the preferences."</p>
                
                <li>What would you say is the most hardest algorithm to code?</li>
                <p style='textStyle'>"So I wouldn’t say that I was implementing algorithms at that point. I think it was I think that often times what really is the most difficult part is getting the algorithm right before writing any code. Because if you think about it. If you get the algorithm down to a point where you can write it not just think about it conceptually and write it in pseudo code, once you have the algorithm pretty much established, pretty much the code more or less follows the algorithm. It might take a little bit more effort right if your using a specific language in order to get the algorithm to actually run right, you might have to initiate a helper function in order for you to get your functionally but I think that in the algorithms course that I took some of the algorithms that were being introduced to were problems of the type, “if you were standing in a dark room on a endless wall, design the shortest amount of time to find your way out of that room” okay, so there isn’t any at first glace. It’s very abstract, it’s very high level. There isn’t really numerical numbers associated with it but upon further analysis from 345 and from 245 we learn about powers of 2 and logarithms and so I think that often times in algorithms the hardest thing really to understand is ideally how to visualize the problem. The hardest problem I had to solve in my algorithm problems were probably any algorithm with pathfinding so dyxtras, your breathe for search, depth for search, things like that mainly because it takes a lot of conceptual intuitiveness."</p>
